--------------------------------------------------
SETTING SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
ChickenVille is a small rural village with five inhabitants and one mayor. It is quiet, isolated, and known for its gigantic 90-kg chicken owned by Farmer Clucksworth. The chicken was insured by Allworld Insurance Company for a large sum. One night, it was kidnapped. No one knows who did it. People suspect it is murdered.

INCIDENT DETAILS
--------------------------------------------------
- The incident happened around midnight.
- The victim (the farmer) reported hearing noises and saw a figure in the dark, carrying a sack running away.
- The figure was described as tall and wearing a dark cloak.
- Everyone was asleep except perhaps one or two villagers who claim to have heard or seen something.
- The detective was sent by the insurance company to investigate.
